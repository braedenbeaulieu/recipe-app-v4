directions:
    - In a large pot, add Potatoes and Garlic whole then fill with cold water until it's all covered. Boil the mixture until the potatoes are soft, roughly 15 mins. Remove the garlic cloves and set them aside. Drain the water and move the potatoes to a mixing bowl. Crush the garlic, add the Butter, Milk, and add salt and pepper to the bowl, then smoosh the potatoes to a smooth consistency.
    - While the potatoes are boiling. In a pan, cook the Onion in some oil until they are getting soft then add the Ground Beef and cook it all the way through. Add the Cremini Mushrooms and cook for another couple minutes. Add Dried Oregano and Cream of Mushroom soup then slowly add a little bit of water while stirring until the soup becomes creamy enough to coat the meat completely. Add salt and pepper if necessary.
    - Layer your ingredients in a baking pan in the order - beef mixture, Corn, potato mixture, then top with a light layer of Bread Crumbs. Put this in the oven at 375Â°F for roughly 15-20 mins until the dish is heated through completely. Leave it out for a minute to cool then it is ready to serve.
