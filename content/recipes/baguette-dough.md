ingredients:
  - qty: 500
    unit: g
    name: White Flour
  - qty: 350
    unit: g
    name: Water
  - qty: 30
    unit: g

    modifier: or
  - qty: 10
    unit: g
    name: Dry Instant Yeast
  - qty: 10
    unit: g
    name: Sea Salt
directions:
  - Starting with Water in the bowl, combine the White Flour, and Fresh Yeast OR Dry Instant Yeast together until the flour is well hydrated
  - Add the Sea Salt and continue kneading
  - Once it is tacky and holding its shape you can knead it on lightly floured surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes, then form a big dough ball
  - Let rest for 1-2 hours, then place in the fridge overnight with plastic wrap over the bowl
  - On the next day leave the dough out almost long enough to come to room temperature then you can section the dough into 200g to 300g chunks which should be rolled immediately
  - Roll the dough into baguettes, score the top of each baguette and lightly flour them before putting in the oven at 425Â°F. Get a second sheet pan hot in the oven, then pour water into it to create steam in the oven
