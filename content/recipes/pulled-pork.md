directions:
    - In a bowl combine the Cumin, Chili Powder, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, and half of the Brown Sugar. Cut the Pork Tenderloin in half, then cover the pork completely with the dry rub.
    - Sear the pork in a Dutch Oven and make sure to sear each side of the meat. Add the Apple Juice then cover and place in the oven for 3 hours. Then remove the lid and put back in the oven for another 2 hours or until it is fork tender.
    - Transfer the meat out of the pot to rest and into the drippings mix the Ketchup, Spicy Mustard, Worcestershire Sauce, Apple Cider Vinegar and the rest of the Brown Sugar and simmer over medium-high heat. While that is going you can shred the pork and return it to the pot after the sauce has thickened. Serve on Kaiser Rolls.
