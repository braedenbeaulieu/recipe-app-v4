directions:
    - In a Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until done. Remove Bacon from pan, and set aside. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.
    - Cook Onion in reserved bacon drippings until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in Garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cubed Potatoes, and toss to coat. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, and add enough Chicken Stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender.
    - In a separate pan, melt Butter over medium heat. Whisk in Flour. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the Heavy Cream, and Dried Herbs. Bring the cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Stir the cream mixture into the potato mixture. Puree about 1/2 the soup, and return to the pan. Adjust seasonings to taste.
