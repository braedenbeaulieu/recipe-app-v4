directions:
    - Cook the Ground Beef in a frying pan. Once cooked through (8-10 mins) add Old El Paso Taco Seasoning packette and a 2/3 cup of water, combine and let the mixture simmer down. This is a good time to preheat the oven.
    - Add Refried Beans to the pan and mix together. Spread the mixture into a baking pan then layer Sour Cream and Tex-Mex Cheese over the top.
    - Once the oven is ready, bake in the center rack for roughly 10 mins or until the cheese on top is melted. Let stand for 5 minutes. Enjoy with Tostitos Scoops.
